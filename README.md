# Hello, I'm Rupa Sree Guttikonda 👋  

👨‍💻 **About Me**  
Hi! I'm a **data science enthusiast** who loves diving into messy datasets and uncovering stories hidden within. My journey began with a curiosity about how data shapes the world around us, and it has since turned into a passion for solving real-world problems through data-driven insights. I’m particularly excited about exploring **machine learning**, **data visualization**, and **NLP** as I continue to grow in this space.

📊 **What I Do**  
I enjoy building practical solutions that make sense of data, from cleaning and analyzing it to developing predictive models that inform decision-making. Lately, I've been fascinated by **deep learning** and its applications in **computer vision** and **language understanding**.

🛠️ **Skills & Tools**  
- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL  
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI  
- **Platforms**: Jupyter Notebooks, Kaggle, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS  

🔭 **Projects I'm Proud Of**  
- **Customer Segmentation**: Used clustering techniques to categorize customers based on behavior for targeted marketing campaigns.  
- **Sales Forecasting**: Built a time series model to predict retail sales, improving accuracy by 20%.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Created an NLP pipeline to analyze public sentiment on trending topics using Twitter data.  

🚀 **What’s Next for Me**  
I’m currently expanding my expertise in **deep learning** and working on a personal project involving **image classification**. Additionally, I’m diving into the world of **AI ethics** and exploring how we can make models fair and transparent.

💡 **Why I Love Data Science**  
For me, data science is all about curiosity and creativity. Every dataset is a puzzle waiting to be solved, and every solution opens up new possibilities. It’s this mix of logic, experimentation, and storytelling that keeps me hooked.
